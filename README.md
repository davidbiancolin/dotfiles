David's hacky ass dotfiles.
==========================

Typical use case: for local setup
```
./setup
make
```

To initialize over a set of millenium like machines:
```
./cluster_master.sh
```
(For when you don't want to host things like vim packages on networked
storage...) Since you probably shouldn't be using vim on anything but the head
node, this shouldn't be all that useful.
